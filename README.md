# Gemography-challenge
[Data Engineering Coding Challenge]
# Description
The purpose of the challenge is to create a web scraper to scrape articles from a news website , web scraping is a versatile challenge because most websites tend to have policies to make scraping difficult or even impossible on their website besides the fact that each website has its own HTML-CSS template that can change from page to page , WashingtonPost website seems to be a good solution due it's stable HTML-CSS structure , but it's limited free access makes scraping large amount of articles impossible in the free version of the website.
# How to use it ?
To simplify the implementation and testing of my solution , I opted for the Google Colab online IDE , so that testing could be done on a remote repository without setting a Docker image or implementing a python env from scratch on a local machine.
Open the notebook on Google Colab , set the links of the Mongodb Atlas cluster and the WashingtonPost article's link and finally run the Flask server and test it with Postman using ngrok exposed link.
